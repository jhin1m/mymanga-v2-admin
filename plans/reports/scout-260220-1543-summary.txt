SCOUT MISSION COMPLETE: CRUD Pattern Analysis
==============================================

OBJECTIVE: Understand patterns for CRUD management pages to create "Pets" feature

FINDINGS GENERATED:
1. scout-260220-1543-crud-pattern-analysis.md (DETAILED)
   - 9 sections covering all architectural patterns
   - Complete breakdown of components, services, templates, routing, menus
   - Code structure, signal patterns, modal patterns, API conventions
   - 9 unresolved questions for Pets implementation

2. scout-260220-1543-crud-pattern-code-snippets.md (ACTIONABLE)
   - Ready-to-use code for all 5 required files
   - Pet-themed example (service, component, template, styles)
   - Route and menu registration snippets
   - Implementation checklist

SCANNED FILES (10 total):
✓ /src/app/pages/achievements/ (3 files)
✓ /src/app/pages/genres/ (3 files)
✓ /src/app/pages/groups/ (3 files)
✓ /src/app/core/services/achievements.service.ts
✓ /src/app/core/services/genres.service.ts
✓ /src/app/core/services/groups.service.ts
✓ /src/app/app.routes.ts
✓ /src/app/core/startup/startup.service.ts
✓ /src/app/shared/pagination-bar/pagination-bar.ts
✓ /src/app/core/models/api-types.ts

KEY PATTERNS EXTRACTED:
- Component architecture (signals, forms, modals, event handlers)
- Service pattern (CRUD operations, HTTP params, type definitions)
- Template structure (search card, table card, pagination)
- Route registration (lazy loading, path naming)
- Menu integration (group, icon, link conventions)
- Styling approach (LESS, ng-zorro utilities)

NEXT STEPS FOR PETS FEATURE:
1. Answer 9 unresolved questions in analysis file
2. Use code snippets as template
3. Customize entity names (Pet, PetsService, etc.)
4. Adapt fields based on backend API contract
5. Follow implementation checklist
6. Test all CRUD operations
